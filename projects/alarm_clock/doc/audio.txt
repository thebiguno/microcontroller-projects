In my enclosure I find that it works best to normalize audio to -15dB.
You can do this via Audacity:
	1) Open file
	2) Effects -> Normalize, -15dB
	3) Export as MP3, fixed rate 44100, 16 bit, 128k/s, stereo

Or you can do this via sox:
	sox -r 44100 <input file> --norm=-15 00x.mp3

A couple bash scripts which can help to copy, number, and convert files is as follows:

Copy and number:
i=79; ls --color=no ~/Music/Library/Artist/Album/* | while read X; do echo $X; cp "$X" $i.mp3; ((i=i+1)); done
(set the i=79 to be the starting number; the path for ls is where you are copying from)

Convert and re-number with leading zero:
ls --color=no * | grep -v ^0 | while read X; do sox -r 44100 --norm=-15 $X 0$X; rm $X; done


01 - 8
02 - 9
03 - 84
