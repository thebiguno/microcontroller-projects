In my enclosure I find that it works best to normalize audio to -1dB.
You can do this via Audacity:
	1) Open file
	2) Effects -> Normalize, -1dB
	3) Export as MP3, fixed rate 44100, 16 bit, 128k/s, stereo

Or you can do this via sox:
	sox -r 44100 <input file> --norm=-1 00x.mp3

A couple bash scripts which can help to copy, number, and convert files is as follows:


i=0; ls * | while read X; do echo $X; cp "$X" $(printf "%03d" $i).mp3; sox --norm=-1 $(printf "%03d" $i).mp3 temp.mp3; mv temp.mp3 $(printf "%03d" $i).mp3; ((i=i+1)); done
	-Run this from a folder which contains all the songs you want converted
	-Set the i=0 to be the starting number
	-The output will be songs numbered 000.mp3, 001.mp3, etc, all normalized to -1dB

ls | grep -e '^[0-9][0-9][0-9].mp3$' | while read X; do mv $X /path/to/destination; done
	-Move the xxx.mp3 files to specified destination
