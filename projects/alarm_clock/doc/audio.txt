In my enclosure I find that it works best to normalize audio to -15dB.
You can do this via Audacity:
	1) Open file
	2) Effects -> Normalize, -15dB
	3) Export as MP3, fixed rate 44100, 16 bit, 128k/s, stereo

Or you can do this via sox:
	sox -r 44100 <input file> --norm=-15 00x.mp3

01 - 8
02 - 9
03 - 48
